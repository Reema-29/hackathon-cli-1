# Contracts Directory

This directory is part of the standard project structure but remains empty for this documentation-only module.

The Digital Twin module (Gazebo & Unity) is a documentation-only feature that explains concepts, best practices, and implementation approaches for digital twin simulation in robotics. Since this module doesn't include any API endpoints or service contracts, this directory serves as a placeholder to maintain consistent project structure.
