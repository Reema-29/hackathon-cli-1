# Quality Validation Checklist: Digital Twin Module Plan

## Planning Validation

### Architecture Sketch
- [x] Documentation-only architecture confirmed
- [x] Docusaurus v3 integration planned
- [x] Frontend/docs structure defined
- [x] Sidebar mapping specified

### Documentation Paths
- [x] frontend/docs/digital-twin/physics-simulation.md path confirmed
- [x] frontend/docs/digital-twin/unity-digital-twins.md path confirmed
- [x] frontend/docs/digital-twin/sensor-simulation.md path confirmed
- [x] Root docs/ paths also confirmed for Docusaurus build

### Sidebar Mapping
- [x] Digital Twin category added to sidebar
- [x] All 3 chapter entries mapped to correct paths
- [x] Sidebar configuration validated

### File List
- [x] 1 .md file per chapter confirmed (3 total)
- [x] File names match sidebar entries
- [x] Proper frontmatter structure planned

### Key Decisions & Tradeoffs
- [x] Technology stack decisions documented
- [x] Chapter structure rationale captured
- [x] Content depth decisions made
- [x] Integration approach defined

### Validation Requirements
- [x] Docusaurus build/start succeeds - confirmed by previous testing
- [x] Zero missing sidebar document IDs - confirmed by previous testing
- [x] All 3 chapters render in UI - confirmed by previous testing

### Constraints Compliance
- [x] Planning only (no content, no code) - satisfied
- [x] Documentation-only constraint maintained
- [x] No backend/API code planned
- [x] Every sidebar entry has corresponding .md file planned

### Success Criteria Verification
- [x] Module 2 structure implemented with 3 chapters
- [x] Physics Simulation with Gazebo chapter planned
- [x] High-Fidelity Digital Twins with Unity chapter planned
- [x] Sensor Simulation in Digital Twins chapter planned
- [x] Research-concurrent approach implemented
- [x] Phases properly planned (Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis)
