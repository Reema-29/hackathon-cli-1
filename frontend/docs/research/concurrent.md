# Concurrent Research

Learn how to perform research concurrently with writing in the AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation System.

## Overview

The concurrent research methodology allows you to research while writing, rather than conducting all research upfront. This approach:

- Maintains writing momentum
- Ensures research is targeted and relevant
- Allows for adaptive research based on content needs
- Reduces research debt through continuous validation

## Research Workflow

### During Writing

When you encounter a need for specific information:

1. Identify the research requirement
2. Submit a research query
3. Review research results
4. Incorporate findings into your content
5. Validate sources and credibility

### Research Tracking

The system tracks research items with:

- Query details
- Source information
- Credibility scores
- Status (pending, verified, rejected)
- Related content links

## Source Validation

All research sources are validated for:

- Credibility and authority
- Currency and relevance
- Accuracy and reliability
- Bias assessment

## Research Debt Management

Track and manage research items that need follow-up:

- Priority scoring
- Scheduling for later research
- Impact assessment on content
- Resolution tracking
